# Attempt Count

Edit the current or total level attempt counts in the game geometry dash. You can also edit the jumps and time.

There is no undo button! I'm not responsible for losing attempts.

### Advanced Note

Because I couldn't figure out what corresponds to the time label, this mod actually tracks its own level playtime and replaces it on the end screen.
